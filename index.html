    <p>Iâ€™m a challenge-driven project leader with five years of experience in simultaneously leading multiple projects from inception to successful delivery. I pride myself on my ability to swiftly understand and master new skills, supported by my attention to detail and interest in delving deeper. The foundation to my approach is hands-on, with a focus on refreshing an existing process, through innovative solutions, to make it more time and cost efficient. I am able to effectively adapt to faced-paced, challenging environments without sacrificing the quality of deliverables. As a leader, I identify and utilise the relevant strengths of those in my team, in order to drive both short and long term success.
